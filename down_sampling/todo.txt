function that inputs data and class labels
	does simple classification (sklearn)
	outputs accuracy

things to make alongside
	mean accuracy of classes as the performance metric
	split train set



ideas:
	downsample based on removing dimentions from nn accuracy?
		might be lil bit naive and also complicaed
